    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Depression (Major depressive disorder) is a common and serious mental health condition 
      which involves loss of interest in activities that were previously enjoyable, feeling 
      worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping little or too much and in extreme cases, 
      there can be thoughts of self-harm. With nearly three in ten adults (29%) being 
      diagnosed with a form of depression at some point and 18% (according to a national survey) 
      currently experiencing it, it has become a severe issue in many peoples' lives today. 
      Depression can occur at nearly any age.

    <h2>Prevalence?</h2>
    <p>
      One of the nations most impacted by the rising prevalence of anxiety and associated 
      mental health disorders is Australia. With approximately 17% of Australians diagnosed 
      with an anxiety disorder, the problem is still getting worse despite continuous national 
      initiatives and raised awareness. These difficulties have been made worse by the COVID-19 
      pandemic's long-term effects, which have increased stress, social isolation, and 
      uncertainty. Effective prevention and treatment strategies are desperately needed 
      nationwide, as evidenced by research showing that anxiety disorders are not only very 
      common but can also play a significant role in the onset of depression.

    <p>
      <strong>Long-term effects:</strong> Untreated depression may lead to chronic health issues, 
      social isolation, substance dependence, and difficulty in maintaining education or employment. 
      These effects can last for years or even a lifetime without intervention.

      <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Depression can run through families, creating a predisposition, though not guaranteed.</li>
      <li><strong>Brain Chemistry:</strong> Imbalances in serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine can increase risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Factors:</strong> Traumatic events, loss, physical trauma, and substance use can contribute.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="treatments">
    <h2>Treatments / Strategies?</h2>
    <p>
      Depression is treated with a combination of strategies, often involving professional medical 
      treatments such as antidepressants and brain stimulation therapies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psychological treatments:</strong> Counseling and therapy (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT) 
      help individuals challenge negative thoughts, improve personal relationships, and change behavioral patterns 
      to reduce depressionâ€™s impact.
